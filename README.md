# Lotcation

**Lotcation** (Parking **Lot** + Lo**cation**) is an iOS app designed to help drivers find parking spaces quickly and safely with minimal interaction while driving.

## Problem Statement

Finding parking in busy urban areas can be stressful and distracting for drivers. Most parking apps require too much interaction, creating safety risks while driving. I hope this app can solve this problem by providing a streamlined, minimal-touch interface designed specifically for use while on the road.

## Technical Details

- Built with **SwiftUI** for modern iOS interfaces
- Custom animations for enhanced user experience
- Focused on **safe driving** by minimizing required interactions
- Intelligent greeting system based on time of day
- Google Maps and Google Sign-in integration

## Current Status

- Initial target market: Santa Monica in Los Angeles County
- Future planned expansion: broader Los Angeles County and San Francisco Bay Area
- Custom splash screen animation implemented
- Main interface with greeting and parking finder buttons complete
